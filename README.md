Used term:

(Really need to remember “Your model” and “COM body”, they will be mentioned a lot in this guide)
-Scripts: Many Python scripts are used to automate some progress. Written and saved inside Zoobot workflow.blend 
-The temp folder: the temp folder contains temporary menu files provided inside Zoobot's modding tools

Requirement:

-NKK mods(mostly for the hair menus):
-Converting tools (to convert .png to .tex, and .txt to .menu):

This guide won’t go over every detail but only provides the fastest and easiest way to port your model to COM3D2 while still keeping the quality. Most of the written steps are just to give you an idea of what going on, watch the video under each tutorial for the full progress.
