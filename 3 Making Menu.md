### 1) Mass rename menu
   
The best way to learn more about making menu is to look at the menu from other mods. This guide won't into the details but only provides a bunch of temporary menus and a script to help mass rename them.
 
  Step to prepare the menu:
+ place your icon to :temp/texture and rename it temp_icon before run, the script will automatically set icon in the game
+ Run "Massrename.py" 
+ Paste your the temp folder direction and your character name when the scripts ask as in the video. The script will automatically rename all characters with temp to your character name.
+ Go to :temp/1menu and convert all .txt to .menu by the "[CM3D2]menu←→txt Converter.exe"

Now, you should have all menus with different names for most of the basic clothes slots inside COM such as wear, stock, shoes,...Delete any menu and model that you don't need. The next step is to work with your model inside blender 


### 2) node hiding

Node hiding is written inside the menu, so it hides a part of the body when equipped with clothes. it is a cheat way to get things done fast. Most of the time you will want to use node hiding as much as you want.
Basically, mess with node表示 (node display) and node 消去 (node delete) until get the result you want. Most useful node hiding can be found in COM Node hiding.docx inside Zoobot's modding tools
